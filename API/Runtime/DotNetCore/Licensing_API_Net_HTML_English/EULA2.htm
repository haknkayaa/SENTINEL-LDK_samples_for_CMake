Preceding such a sale and sub-licensing, you shall make sure that your contracts with any of your distributors and/or end users (and their contracts with their customers) shall contain warranties, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and license terms which are no less protective of Thales's rights than such equivalent provisions contained herein. In addition, you shall make it abundantly clear to your distributors and/or end users, that Thales is not and shall not, under any circumstances, be responsible or liable in any way for the software and software licenses contained in your computer programs which you merge with the Thales Software and distribute to your distributors and/or end users, including, without limitation, with respect to extending license terms and providing maintenance for any software elements and/or computer programs which are not the Thales Software.

If any modifications are made to the Software or to any other part of the Product by you; if the media, the Sentinel key, or the microSD card is subjected to accident, abuse, or improper use; or if you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, then the warranty in Section 2.3 above, shall immediately be terminated. The warranty shall not apply if the Software is used on or in conjunction with hardware or program other than the unmodified version of hardware and program with which the Software was designed to be used as described in the Sentinel LDK Software Protection and Licensing Guide. The limited warranty does not cover any damage to the microSD card that results from improper installation, accident, abuse, misuse, natural disaster, insufficient or excessive electrical supply, abnormal mechanical or environmental conditions, or any unauthorized disassembly, repair or modification. This limited warranty shall not apply if: (i) the microSD card was not used in accordance with any accompanying instructions, or (ii) the product was not used for its intended function. This limited warranty also does not apply to any microSD card on which the original identification information has been altered, obliterated or removed, that has not been handled or packaged correctly, that has been sold as second-hand or that has been resold contrary to U.S. and other applicable export regulations.</p>

In the event of a breach of the warranty set forth above, Thales's sole obligation, and your sole remedy shall be, at Thales's sole discretion: (i) to replace or repair the Product, or component thereof, that does not meet the foregoing limited warranty, free of charge; or (ii) to refund the price paid by you for the Product, or component thereof. Any replacement or repaired component will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer. Warranty claims must be made in writing during the warranty period and within seven (7) days of the observation of the defect accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Thales. All Products should be returned to the distributor from which they were purchased (if not purchased directly from Thales) and shall be shipped by the returning party with freight and insurance paid. The Product or component thereof must be returned with a copy of your receipt. Thales is not liable for, and does not cover under warranty, any damages or losses of any kind whatsoever resulting from loss of, damage to or corruption of, content or data or any costs associated with determining the source of system problems or removing, servicing or installing the microSD card. This warranty excludes third party software, connected equipment or stored data. Thales is therefore not liable for any losses or damage attributable to third party software, connected equipment or stored data. In the event of a claim, Thales’s sole obligation shall be to issue a refund or replacement of the microSD card.</p>

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
                                                        <p xmlns="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
